diameter-analysis

Perform edge detection on individual line profiles by convolving the line profile with the 1D Laplace filter [1, -2, 1] and finding the zero-crossings. Zero-crossings with the largest positive and largest negative local intensity variation were identified as the two edges for computing vessel diameter.
